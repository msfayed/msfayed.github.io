<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
I came across an application that I want to explore it's private files (especially the downloaded media files) and after searching some try and error I found that an easy way to to it is by using ADB tools to backup the application to my PC and then decompress and decrypt&nbsp; the backup file (because my mobile is encrypted and so the backup must be encrypted too) and then extract the media files :)<br />
<br />
1- I used <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2588979" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">this ADB installer</span></a> so I don't have to install the full SDK.<br />
<br />
2- Then I downloaded  <a href="https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases"><span style="color: blue;">android-backup-extractor</span></a> to extract the the backup file.<br />
3- if you are using Java 8 Update 161 or later skip this step as<span style="color: blue;">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u161-relnotes-4021379.html#JDK-8170157">Oracle's release notes for Java 8 Update 161</a></span>, stated that unlimited cryptography is enabled by default.<br />
<br />
and to be able to decrypt the backup file you will need to download&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html"><span style="color: blue;">Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html"><span style="color: blue;">Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8</span></a>&nbsp;according to your java run-time version.<br />
<br />
then I executed the bellow command :<br />
<br />
<pre>adb backup -noapk com.MyApp.AppName
</pre>
<br />
then<br />
<br />
<pre>java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.ab.tar [MyPassword]
</pre>
<br />
like :<br />
<br />
<pre style="background-color: black; color: white; white-space: pre-wrap; width: 100%;">C:\adb
λ adb backup -noapk com.MyApp.AppName
Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation.

C:\adb
λ java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.ab.tar [MyPassword]
